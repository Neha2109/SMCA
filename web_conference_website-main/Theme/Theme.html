                        <p class="about__text">The revolution in information technologies has changed the nature of computing. The advances in the Internet and its technologies make it possible for geographically dispersed entities (e.g., mobile devices, sensor and IoT devices, software agents, hardware, etc.) to interact. These entities offer various kinds of services not only to similar types of entities but also different objects (for instance, end-users, organizations, businesses, etc.) available at the Internet edge. In the new computing paradigm, these entities are the decision-makers and work together for their owners either in a centralized or decentralized fashion. It is likely that these autonomous entities are self-interested and work for their respective owners to obtain individual goals. These individual goals may be different (or opposite) to socially desirable (in a decentralized setting) and the goal of a central planner (in a centralized setting). Therefore, it is important to analyze the interactions of multiple self-interested entities and provide design solutions by incentivizing these self-interested entities to achieve a system optima. 
                            In computer science, the tools like game theory/ mechanism design stem from economics are widely used to model the interaction of strategic entities and design incentive schemes to improve the systemâ€™s performance. In fact, game theory has emerged as an important element in the development of recent technologies like Blockchain, Federated learning, Internet-of-Things, etc. Therefore, it is a need of an hour to understand, analyses and explore modelling incentives in computer sciences to achieve the success of the new computing paradigm. The conference focuses on the intersection of computer science, game theory, economics, operations research, control, and society and technology
